**IBM DATA ANALYST CAPSTONE PROJECT**
This is the Capstone Project for Course 9, IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project. Part of IBM's Data Analyst Professional Certificate from Coursera. 
In this project, we will take on the role of a Data Analyst in an IT firm seeking to understand the current trends in technology amongst developers. The analyst covers the current technologies, desired technologies and demographic information of developers.

The aim of this analysis is to make data-driven decisions regarding which technologies the company should invest for training current developers within the firm and even potential hires. Additionally, location and demographic data of developers in analyzed to further aid in training efforts and during the hiring process.

The data for analysis was gathered from various sources by **API and webscraping using Python**. The gathered data was then cleaned and prepared for analysis which included statistical analysis, correlation and initial charts using Python libraries. Finally, the data was loaded in **IBM Cognos** to create the final dashboard visualization.
